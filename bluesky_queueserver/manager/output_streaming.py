class ReceiveConsoleOutput:

    one as they arrive. Subscription is performed using the remote 0MQ address and topic.

    published message. The following example contains the code illustrating using the class.
    In real-world  application the loop will be running in a separate thread and generating
    callbacks on each received message.

    The ``subscribe()`` and ``unsubscribe()`` methods allow to explicitly subscribe and
    unsubscribe the socket to the topic. The messages published while the socket is unsubscribed
    are discarded. First call to ``recv()`` method automatically subscribes the socket.

        will do a simple operation such as adding the received message to the queue.
