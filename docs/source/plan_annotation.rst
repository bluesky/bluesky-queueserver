Annotating Bluesky Plans
========================

.. currentmodule:: bluesky_queueserver

Introduction
------------

Queue Server is using information on existing plans and devices stored in
``existing_plans_and_devices.yaml`` file for validating submitted plans. The file
must be generated using ``qserver-list-plans-devices`` CLI tool
(see :ref:`qserver_list_plans_devices_cli`) from the most recent startup script(s)
or module. The tool loads the startup code in the RE Worker namespace, identifies
devices and plans, generates representation of plans and devices and saves
results to a file.

Representations of plans generated by ``qserver-list-plans-devices`` contain items
such as text descriptions of plans and plan parameters, parameter type annotations,
default values and ranges for numerical values. The representations are sufficient
to perform validation of parameters of submitted plans without access to startup
scripts or RE Worker namespace. Plan representations can also be downloaded by
client applications (:ref:`method_plans_allowed` 0MQ API) and used to validate
plan parameters before the plans are submitted to the server. For details on plan
parameter validation see :ref:`plan_validation`.
Client applications may also use items such as text descriptions, type annotations,
default values and ranges for generating or annotating user interfaces (e.g.
GUI forms for plan parameters).

In this manual, the elements of a plan (Python function) header, docstring and
the parameters of the optional ``parameter_annotation_decorator`` that are used
for generating plan representations are referred as **plan annotation**.

All elements in plan annotations are optional. But properly annotating plans may be
beneficial if features such as parameter validation or automated user interface generation
are needed. For example in cases when users are manually entering plan parameter
values in Qt or web forms, it is preferable to detect errors
at the time when the plans are submitted to the queue and reject plans as opposed
to waiting for plans to fail when they are sent for execution.

.. note::

  Validation of plan parameters is performed each time a new or modified plan is
  submitted to Queue Server. Validation can be also performed on the client side
  before the plan is submitted. To run validation the client must download
  the lists of allowed plans and devices  (:ref:`method_plans_allowed` and
  `:ref:`method_devices_allowed` 0MQ API) and call `validate_plan()`
  (:ref:`plan_validation_api`).

Plan annotation may contain the following (optional) elements:

* **Description of the plan**: multiline text that describes the plan.
  The plan description may be displayed to users by client applications.

* **Descriptions for each parameter of the plan**: multiline text that describes
  a plan parameter. Separate description is provided for each parameter.
  Parameter descriptions may be displayed to users by client applications.

* **Type annotations for each parameter**. Parameter types are used
  for validation of plan parameters. The types may also be used by client applications
  for generating user interfaces.

* **Default values for each parameter**. The parameters with defined default values
  are optional (following Python rules). The default values are used
  for parameter validation. The default values may also be used by client applications
  for generating user interfaces.

* **Minimum, maximum and step values for each numerical parameter**. The optional
  minimum and maximum values define allowed range for numerical parameter values
  that is used in parameter validation. Step size is passed to client application
  and may be useful in generating user interfaces.

The elements of plan annotations are defined in the plan header (type hints and
default values) and the docstring (parameter descriptions). In addition, Queue Server
provides ``parameter_annotation_decorator`` (:ref:`parameter_annotation_decorator`),
which allows to define or override any annotation item. The decorator is optional
and should be used only when necessary.

.. note::

  When a plan is executed in IPython environment, it behaves as a regular Python
  generator function. Only the default values defined in the plan header are used.
  Any elements defined in ``parameter_annotation_decorator`` are ignored.

.. _plans_without_annotation:

Plans Without Annotation (Default Rules)
----------------------------------------

All elements of arameter annotations are optional. Plans without annotations can be
successfully managed by Queue Server. The text descriptions of plans and plan
parameters are intended for use by client applications and have no influence on
Queue Server operation.

Parameter types and default values are used for plan parameter validation. The parameters
with defined default values are **optional**. Values for the **required** parameters
(without default values) must be specified when plans are submitted to the queue.

For each parameter with specified type annotation, parameter validation includes
checking the type of the submitted parameter value. The parameters with no type
annotation are treated according to the default rules:

* type checking always succeeds, i.e. any submitted value is accepted
  and passed to the plan (the plan execution may fail due to incorrect parameter type).

* the parameter values parsed and all detected strings that are matching names of
  objects (plans or devices) in the RE Worker namespace are replaced with references
  to the objects (see details below).

The validation algorithm is processing annotations for each parameter independently.
The parameters with defined types are subjected to type checking, while the parameters
with no type annotations are processed using the default rules.

The examples of the plans with no annotation:

.. code-block:: python

  def plan_demo1a(npts, delay):
      # Parameters 'npts' and 'delay' accept values of any type.
      #   No validation of parameter value types will be performed
      #   before execution of the plan is started. The plan will probably
      #   fail if parameters are of incorrect type.
      <code implementing the plan>

  def plan_demo1b(npts, delay=1.0):
      # Same as 'plan_demo1' except the default value for parameter 'delay' is
      #   specified, which makes the parameter 'delay' optional.
      #   No type validation is performed for any parameter.
      <code implementing the plan>

Queue Server supports plans that are accepting references to devices or other plans.
The devices or plans passed as parameters must be defined in startup scripts and
loaded in RE Worker namespace and represented in ``existing_plans_and_devices.yaml``.
When plan parameters are submitted Queue Server, the devices and plans must
be represented by their names (type ``str``). The names are replaced by
references to objects in RE Worker namespace before the parameters are passed to the plan
for execution. Submitted parameter values are parsed and each strings found in the tree
formed by lists, tuples and dictionaries is replaced with a reference to an objects with
the matching name. If there is no object with the name matching the string or the name
is not in the list of allowed plans or allowed devices for the user submitting the plan,
then the string is not modified. Dictionary keys are never modified.

The operation of replacing plan and device names with references to objects from RE Worker
namespace is performed for each parameter with no type annotation. This means that
every string that matches a name of a device or a plan from the list of allowed
devices or the list of allowed plans is replaced by the reference to the respective object
from RE Worker namespace.

Let's consider an example of a plan with parameter ``detectors`` that is expected to
receive a list of detectors:

.. code-block:: python

  from ophyd.sim import det1, det2, det3
  # Assume that the detectors 'det1', 'det2', 'det3' are included in the list
  #   of allowed devices for the user submitting the plan.

  def plan_demo1c(detectors, npts):
      # The parameter 'detectors' is expected to receive a list of detectors.
      # There is no type annotation, so the type is not validated.
      <code implementing the plan>

If the plan parameters submitted to the queue contain ``"detectors": ["det1", "det3"]``,
then the strings ``"det1"`` and ``"det3"`` are replaced with references to objects
``det1`` and ``det3`` and the plan is executed as if it was called from IPython
using

.. code-block:: python

  RE(plan_demo1c([det1, det3], <value of npts>))

Blindly attempting to convert all strings in the passed parameter to references
works well in most of the simple cases, unless the workflow requires to pass strings
that are names of existing objects without converting them to references. If automated
conversion is causing issues, it can be disabled for any given parameter by
specifying the parameter type (e.g. using type hints in the plan header).
For example, one may need to pass plan or device names to the plan:

.. code-block:: python

    import typing
    from ophyd.sim import det1, det2, det3
    # Assume that the detectors 'det1', 'det2', 'det3' are in the list
    #   of allowed devices for the user submitting the plan.

    def plan_demo1d(detector_names, npts):
        # The parameter 'detector_names' is expected to receive a list of detector names.
        #   DOES NOT WORK: references to objects will be passed
        <code implementing the plan>

    def plan_demo1e(detector_names: typing.List[str], npts):
        # The parameter 'detector_names' is expected to receive a list of detector names.
        #   WORKS !!!
        <code implementing the plan>

If the value ``"detector_names": ["det1", "det3"]`` is passed to the plan ``plan_demo1d``,
then the detector names are converted to references. Adding type hint for the parameter
``detector_names`` (see ``plan_demo1e``) disables string conversion and names are passed
to the plan unchanged. Adding type hint also enables type validation for parameter
``detector_names`` and the plan is going to be rejected by Queue Server if the submitted
value is not a list of strings. Type hint may be as restrictive as needed. For example,
type hint ``typing.Any`` will still disable conversion of strings, but the server will accept
value of any type.

The operation of string conversion always succeeds. If the device name is incorrectly spelled
or not in the list of allowed plans or devices, then name remains a string and is passed
to the plan unchanged. For example, assume that ``"detectors": ["det1", "det4"]`` is passed to
``plan_demo1c``. There is no device named ``det4`` in the RE Worker namespace, so it will
not be converted to reference. As a result, the ``detectors`` parameter will receive a list
``[det1, "det4"]`` and the plan will fail during execution. Queue Server provides
``parameter_annotation_decorator`` (:ref:`parameter_annotation_decorator`), which can be
used to define types for advanced parameter validation. In particular, the decorator
allows to define custom enums based on lists of device or plan names that could be used
to restrict object names that that could be passed to the parameter. Specifying lists
of plans or devices enables the string conversion, but only the listed names will
be converted to references.

.. code-block:: python

    from ophyd.sim import det1, det2, det3
    # Assume that the detectors 'det1', 'det2', 'det3' are in the list
    #   of allowed devices for the user submitting the plan.

    from bluesky_queueserver import parameter_annotation_decorator

    @parameter_annotation_decorator({
        "parameters": {
            "detectors": {
                "annotation": "typing.List[DevicesType1]",
                "devices": {"DevicesType1": ["det1", "det2", "det3"]}
            }
        }
    })
    def plan_demo1f(detectors, npts):
        # The parameter 'detector_names' is expected to receive a list of detector names.
        <code implementing the plan>

The type annotation in the decorator overrides the type annotation in the function header.
Only the lists of device names from the predefined set are accepted by the server.
If the submitted plan contains ``"detectors": ["det1", "det4"]``, then the plan is rejected.

.. note::

  Value of any type that is serializable to JSON can be passed to the plan if
  the respective parameter type is not defined or defined as ``typing.Any``.
  In the latter case the server does not attempt to convert strings to references
  to objects.

.. _supported_types:

Supported Types
---------------

Queue Server puts restrictions on types used for type annotations and default values. If a plan header
contains parameter type annotation that is not supported, Queue Server ignores the annotation
and the plan is processed as if the parameter contained no annotation. If unsupported type annotation
is defined in ``parameter_annotation_decorator``, then processing of the plan fails and plan
representation for ``existing_plans_and_devices.yaml`` can not be generated.
Processing also fails if the default value defined in the plan header or in the decorator has
unsupported type.

.. note::

  Type annotations and default values defined in ``parameter_annotation_decorator`` override type
  annotations and default values defined in the plan header. If type or default value is defined
  in the decorator, the respective type and default value from the header are not analyzed.
  If it is unavoidable that the plan must have unsupported type annotation or default value
  in the header, then the ``parameter_annotation_decorator`` should be used to override
  the type or default value in order for the plan processing to work.

**Supported types for type annotations.** Type annotations may be native Python types
(such as ``int``, ``float``, ``str``, etc.), ``NoneType``, or generic types that are based
on native Python types (``typing.List[typing.Union[int, str]]``). Technically the type will
be accepted if the operation of creating the type object from its string representation
using ``eval`` function and the namespace that contains imported ``typing`` module and
``NoneType`` type should be successful.

**Supported types of default values.** The default values can be objects of native Python
types and literal expressions with objects of native Python types. The default value should
be reconstructable with function ``ast.literal_eval``, i.e. for the default value ``vdefault``,
the operation ``ast.literal_eval(f"{vdefault!r}")`` should complete successfully.

The following is an example of a plan with type annotation that is not be accepted
by Queue Server. The type annotation is defined in the plan header,  so it is ignored
and no type annotation is included in the plan representation for the parameter ``detector``.

.. code-block:: python

  from ophyd import Device

  def plan_demo2a(detector: Device, npts=10):
      # Type 'Device' is not recognized by Queue Server, because it needs to be imported
      #   from Ophyd. Type annotation will be ignored by Queue Server.
      #   Use 'parameter_annotation_decorator' to override annotation for
      #   'detector' of type annotation is required.
      <code implementing the plan>

In the following example, the type of the default value of the ``detector`` parameter is not
supported and processing of the plan fails. The issue can be fixed by overriding the default value
using ``parameter_annotation_decorator`` (:ref:`parameter_annotation_decorator`).

.. code-block:: python

  from ophyd.sim import det1

  def plan_demo2b(detector=det1, npts=10):
      # Default value 'det1' can not be used with the Queue Server.
      #   Fix: use 'parameter annotation decorator to override the default value.
     <code implementing the plan>


Defining Types in Plan Header
-----------------------------

As part of processing plans from RE Worker namespace, Queue Server is analyzing
plan signatures. If a plan signature contains type hints, the types are validated, and their string
representation is saved. Type hints that fail validation are ignored and Queue Server assumes
that the parameter has not type annotation.

.. note::

  Queue Server ignores type hints defined in the plan signature for parameters that have
  type annotations defined in ``parameter_annotation_decorator``.

The acceptable types include Python base types, ``NoneType`` and imports from ``typing`` module
(see :ref:`supported_types`). Following are the examples of plans with type hints:

.. code-block:: python

  import typing
  from typing import List, Optional

  def plan_demo3a(detector, name: str, npts: int, delay: float=1.0):
      # Type of 'detector' not defined, therefore Queue Server will find and attempt to
      #   replace all strings passed to this parameter by references to objects in
      #   RE Worker namespace. Specifying a type hint for the ``detector`` parameter
      #   will disable the automatic string conversion.
      <code implementing the plan>

  def plan_demo3b(positions: typing.Union[typing.List[float], None]=None):
      # Explicitly using the 'typing' module. Setting default value to 'None'.
      <code implementing the plan>

  def plan_demo3c(positions: Optional[List[float]]=None):
      # This example is precisely identical to the previous example. Both hints are
      #   converted to 'typing.Union[typing.List[float], NoneType]' and
      #   correctly processed by the Queue Server.
      <code implementing the plan>


Defining Default Values in Plan Header
--------------------------------------

Follow Python syntax guidelines for defining default values. The type of
the default value must be supported by the Queue Server (see :ref:`supported_types`).
If the default value must have type, which is not supported, override the default
value in ``parameter_annotation_decorator``.

.. note::

  If the default value is defined in the ``parameter_annotation_decorator``,
  Queue Server ignores the default value defined in the header. A default value
  in the header is **required** if the default value is defined in the decorator.

Parameter Descriptions in Docstring
-----------------------------------

Queue Server will collect text descriptions of the plan and parameters from NumPy-style
docstrings. Type information specified in docstrings is ignored. The example below
shows a plan with a docstring:

.. code-block:: python

  def plan_demo4a(detector, name, npts, delay=1.0):
      """
      This is the description of the plan that could be passed
      to the client and displayed to users.

      Parameters
      ----------
      detector : ophyd.Device
          The detector (Ophyd device). Space is REQUIRED before
          and after ':' that separates the parameter name and
          type. Type information is ignored.
      name
          Name of the experiment. Type is optional. Queue Server
          will still successfully process the docstring.
          Documenting types of all parameters is recommended
          practice.
      npts : int
          Number of experimental points.
      delay : float
          Dwell time.
      """
      <code implementing the plan>


.. _parameter_annotation_decorator:

Parameter Annotation Decorator
------------------------------

The ``parameter_annotation_decorator`` allows to override any annotation item of the plan,
including text descriptions of the plan and parameters, parameter type annotations and
default values. The decorator can be used to define all annotation items of a plan, but
it is generally advised that it is used only when absolutely necessary.

.. note::

  If the default value of a parameter is defined in the decorator, the parameter **must**
  have a default value defined in the header. The default values in the decorator and
  the header do not have to match. See the :ref:`notes <default_values_in_decorator>`
  for the use case.

Plan and Parameter Descriptions
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Text descriptions of plans and parameters are not used by Queue Server and do not
affect processing of plans. In some applications it may be desirable to have
different versions of text descriptions in plan documentation (e.g. technical description)
and in user interface (e.g. instructions on how to use plans remotely). The decorator
allows to override plan and/or parameter descriptions from the docstring. In this
case the descriptions defined in the decorator will be displayed to the user.

All parameters in `parameter_annotation_decorator` are optional. In the following
example, the description for the parameter `npts` is not overridden by the decorator:

.. code-block::  python

  from bluesky_queueserver import parameter_annotation_decorator

  @parameter_annotation_decorator({
      "description": "Plan description displayed to users.",
      "parameters": {
          "detector": {
              "description":
                  "Description of the parameter 'detector'\n" \
                   "displayed to Queue Server users",

          }
          "name": {
              "description":
                  "Description of the parameter 'name'\n" \
                  "displayed to Queue Server users",
          }
      }
  })
  def plan_demo4a(detector, name, npts):
      """
      Plan description, which is part of documentation.
      It is not visible to Queue Server users.

      Parameters
      ----------
      detector : ophyd.Device
          The detector. Technical description,
          not visible to Queue Server users.
      name
          Name of the experiment. Technical description,
          not visible to Queue Server users.
      npts : int
          Number of experimental points.
          Description remains visible to Queue Server users,
          because it is not overridden by the decorator.
      """
      <code implementing the plan>


Parameter Types
+++++++++++++++

Parameter type hints defined in the plan header can be overridden in
``parameter_annotation_decorator``. The type annotations defined in the decorator
do not influence execution of plans in Python. Overriding types should be avoided
whenever possible.

.. note::

  Types in the decorator must be represented as string literals. E.g. ``"str"``
  represents string type, ``"typing.List[int]"`` represents an array
  of integers, etc. Module name ``typing`` must be explictly used when
  defining generic types.

Type annotations defined in the decorator may be used to override unsupported type hints
in plan headers. But the main application of the decorator is to define custom enums
based on lists of names of plans and devices or string literals. Support for custom enums
is integrated in functionality of Queue Server, including type validation and string
conversion. If parameter type defined in the annotation includes custom enum type
based on plans or devices, all plan or device names passed to the parameter that match
the names used in type definition are converted to references to plans and devices in
RE Worker namespace. The lists of names of plans and devices or string literals may
also be used by client applications to generate user interfaces
(e.g. populate combo boxes for selecting device names).

.. code-block:: python

  from typing import List
  from ophyd import Device
  from ophyd.sim import det1, det2, det3, det4, det5
  from bluesky_queueserver import parameter_annotation_decorator

  @parameter_annotation_decorator({
      "parameters": {
          "detector": {
              # 'DetectorType1' is the type name (should be a valid Python name)
              "annotation": "DetectorType1",
              # 'DetectorType1' is defined as custom enum with string values
              #   'det1', 'det2' and 'det3'
              "devices": {"DetectorType1": ["det1", "det2", "det3"]},
          }
      }
  })
  def plan_demo5a(detector, npts: int, delay: float=1.0):
      # Type hint for the parameter 'detector' in the header is not required.
      # Queue Server will accept the plan if 'detector' parameter value is
      #   a string with values 'det1', 'det2' or 'det3'. The string will
      #   be replaced with the respective reference before the plan is executed.
      #   Plan validation will fail if the parameter value is not in the set.
      <code implementing the plan>

  @parameter_annotation_decorator({
      "parameters": {
          "detectors": {
              # Note that type definition is a string !!!
              # Type names 'DetectorType1' and 'DetectorType2' are defined
              #   only for this parameter. The types with the same names
              #   may be defined differently for the other parameters
              #   of the plan if necessary, but doing so is not recommended.
              "annotation": "typing.Union[typing.List[DetectorType1]" \
                            "typing.List[DetectorType2]]",
              "devices": {"DetectorType1": ["det1", "det2", "det3"],
                          "DetectorType2": ["det1", "det4", "det5"]},
          }
      }
  })
  def plan_demo5b(detectors: List[Device], npts: int, delay: float=1.0):
      # Type hint contains correct Python type that will be passed to the parameter
      #   before execution.
      # Queue Server will accept the plan if 'detectors' is a list of strings
      #   from any of the two sets. E.g. ['det1', 'det3'] or ['det4', 'det5']
      #   will be accepted but ['det2', 'det4'] will be rejected (because the
      #   detectors belong to different lists).
      <code implementing the plan>

Similar syntax may be used to define custom enums for plans (use ``"plans"`` dictionary key
instead of ``"devices"``) or strings (use ``"enums"`` dictionary key). The strings listed
as ``"devices"`` are converted to references to devices and the strings listed as ``"plans"``
are converted to references to plans before plan execution. Strings listed under ``"enums"``
are not converted to references, but still used for plan parameter validation.
Mixing devices, plans and enums in one type definition is possible (Queue Server will handle
the types correctly), but not recommended.

The decorator supports three built-in enum types: ``AllDetectors``, ``AllMotors`` and ``AllFlyers``.
The built-in enum types should not be defined in the parameter annotation. The enums
include lists of all detectors (readable devices), all motors (readable and writable devices) or
all flyers (flyable devices) from the namespace. Explicitly defining those types in the annotation
for a parameter overrides the default behavior (only for one plan parameter).

.. code-block:: python

  from ophyd.sim import det1, det2, det3, det4
  from bluesky_queueserver import parameter_annotation_decorator

  @parameter_annotation_decorator({
      "parameters": {
          "detectors": {
              # 'AllDetectors' is the built-in enum type. All detectors (readable
              #   devices) from the namespace will be automatically included
              #   in the list ('det1', 'det2', 'det3' and 'det4').
              "annotation": "typing.List[AllDetectors]",
              # Explicitly defining the type 'AllDetectors' will override
              #   the default behavior (only for this parameter).
          }
      }
  })
  def plan_demo5c(detectors, npts: int, delay: float=1.0):
      <code implementing the plan>

Definitions of custom enums for devices or plans may include any devices from RE Worker
namespace. The definitions are included in representation of plans in the list of existing
plans. If built-in enum types are used, the definitions will contain full lists of
devices from the namespace. When lists of allowed plans are generated for user groups,
type definitions are filtered based on user group permissions, so that only the devices
and plans that are allowed for the user group remain. This allows to use entries
from downloaded lists of allowed plans for validation of plans and for generation of
user interfaces without verification user permissions, since it is guaranteed,
that the type definitions contain only devices and plans that the current user
is allowed to use. Filtering of type definitions may cause some lists to become empty
in case current user does not have permission to use any devices or plans that are
listed in type definition.

.. _default_values_in_decorator:

Default Values
++++++++++++++

Using decorator to override default values defined in plan header with different values
is possible, but generally not recommended unless absolutely necessary. Overriding the default
value is justified when the type of the default value defined in the header is not supported,
but the type of the default value defined in the decorator is supported
and passing this value with the plan submitted to the queue leads to the same
result as directly passing the default value defined in the header to the plan
(e.g. in IPython).

.. note::

  The default value defined in the decorator must be represented as a string (as type
  annotation). E.g. ``"10"`` represents integer value ``10``, ``"'det1'"`` represents
  the string value ``'det1'`` and ``"['det1', 'det2']"`` represents an array of strings.

The following example illustrates the user case which requires overriding the default value.
In this example, the default value for the parameter ``detector`` is a reference to ``det1``,
which has unsupported type. It is required that when the plan is submitted to Queue Server,
and no value for ``detector`` parameter is provided, then the string ``"det1"`` is used
as a default value, which is then substituted by reference to ``det1``. The decorator
contains the definition of custom enum for supported device names and sets the default
value as a string representing the name of one of the supported devices.
