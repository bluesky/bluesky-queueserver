Command-Line Tools
==================

.. _start_re_manager_cli:

start-re-manager
----------------

The command starts Run Engine (RE) Manager on the workstation. If no parameters are
specified, RE Manager is started in demo mode (built-in startup files with simulated
devices and plans will be used). Demo mode is sufficient for evaluation and testing
of Queue Server. The CLI parameters may be used to customize RE Manager and specify
the location of beamline startup scripts.

Location of Startup Code
++++++++++++++++++++++++

RE Manager may create RE Worker environments based based on startup code from
IPython-style collection of startup scripts, Python script or Python module.
The locations of autogenerated ``existing_plans_and_devices.yaml`` file (see
:ref:`qserver_list_plans_devices_cli`) and ``user_group_permissions.yaml``
must also be specified.

**IPython-style collection of startup scripts:**
Use the parameter ``--startup-dir`` to specify the directory path to
the collection of startup file. Both ``.yaml`` files are expected to be
located in the startup directory. If the location the ``.yaml`` files is different,
use the parameters ``--existing-plans-devices`` and ``--user-group-permissions``
to specify the correct paths.

**Ipython profile:**
If the collection of startup scripts is located in ``startup`` directory in
one of the IPython profiles, the profile name may be passed to RE Manager
using the parameter ``--startup-profile``. This option is implemented for
convenience and allows to avoid specifying long path to startup directory.

**Python script:**
Use the parameter ``--startup-script`` to specify the path to Python
script that contains startup code (``.py`` file). Only the single script
will be loaded. The script may contain imports from other scripts or modules.
Since there is no obvious location for the ``.yaml`` files, the paths
to the files must be explicitely specified using parameters
``--existing-plans-devices`` and ``--user-group-permissions``.

**Python module:**
Use the parameter ``--startup-module`` to specify the name of the installed
module that contains startup code. Paths to both ``.yaml`` files must be
explicitly specified.

Instances of Run Engine and Databroker
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By default, RE Manager removes ``RE`` and ``db`` objects from RE Worker
namespace and creates the new instances. In many cases, startup scripts contain
the code that creates and configures instances ``RE`` and/or ``db``.
To disable the default behavior and keep instances of ``RE`` and ``db``
created in startup scripts, start RE Manager with the parameter ``--keep-re``.
RE Worker environment will fail to open if ``--keep-re`` is used and startup
scripts do not create the instance of ``RE``.

RE Manager supports a number of standard options of subscribing ``RE`` to callbacks.
All the subscriptions can be performed in startup code, so those options
are implemented mostly for convenience. The options work in cases when
``RE`` is created in startup script or RE Manager. (Note, that ``--keep-re``
must be used to preserve the instance of ``RE`` created in the startup script.
The parameters supporting the subscription options:

- ``--databroker-config`` subscribes RE to Data Broker with the given
  configuration name.

- ``--zmq-data-proxy-addr`` address of 0MQ proxy for publishing
  documents generated by Run Engine.

- ``--kafka-server`` and ``--kafka-topic`` for publishing
  documents generated by Run Engine.

- ``--use-persistent-metadata`` enables msgpack-based persistent storage
  for scan metadata

.. _start_re_manager_console_output:

Console Ouput
+++++++++++++

RE Manager captures output to ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` produced by itself and
running plans. The output may be printed to terminal and/or published to
a 0MQ socket (different socket from the socket used for control communication).

- ``--zmq-publish-console-addr`` allows to set the address for the 0MQ 'PUB' socket.

- Setting ``--zmq-publish-console ON`` enables publishing of the collected output to
  0MQ socket.

- Setting ``--console-output OFF`` disables printing to terminal.

Encryption for 0MQ Control Communication Channel
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If the ``QSERVER_ZMQ_PRIVATE_KEY`` environment variable contains a string that represents
valid private key, the enryption for control channel is enabled. Clients must use correct
public key from public/private key pair to communicate with RE Manager. Public/private
key pair can be generated using :ref:`qserver_zmq_keys_cli`.

Other Configuration Parameters
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- ``--zmq-addr`` is the address of 0MQ socket for the server. The server is managed by RE Manager
  and used to pass control commands from clients.

- ``--redis-addr`` is the address of Redis server
  used by RE Manager as persistent storage.

- ``--verbose``, ``--quiet`` and ``--silent`` options modify logging verbosity
  level for RE Manager.

    Start Run Engine (RE) Manager
    bluesky-queueserver version 0.0.5.post2+g8b7648d

    Encryption for ZeroMQ communication server may be enabled by setting QSERVER_ZMQ_PRIVATE_KEY
    environment variable to a valid private key (z85-encoded 40 character string):

        export QSERVER_ZMQ_PRIVATE_KEY='<private_key>'

    A public/private key pair may be generated by running 'qserver-zmq-keys'. If RE Manager is
    configured to use encrypted channel, the encryption must also be enabled at the client side
    using the public key from the generated pair. Encryption is disabled by default.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --zmq-addr ZMQ_ADDR
                        The address of ZMQ server (control connection), e.g. 'tcp://*:60615'
                        (default: tcp://*:60615).
      --startup-dir STARTUP_DIR
                        Path to directory that contains a set of startup files (*.py and
                        *.ipy). All the scripts in the directory will be sorted in
                        alphabetical order of their names and loaded in the Run Engine Worker
                        environment. The set of startup files may be located in any accessible
                        directory.
      --startup-profile PROFILE_NAME
                        The name of IPython profile used to find the location of startup
                        files. Example: if IPython is configured to look for profiles in
                        '~/.ipython' directory (default behavior) and the profile name is
                        'testing', then RE Manager will look for startup files in
                        '~/.ipython/profile_testing/startup' directory.
      --startup-module STARTUP_MODULE_NAME
                        The name of the module with startup code. The module is imported each
                        time the RE Worker environment is opened. Example:
                        'some.startup.module'. Paths to the list of existing plans and devices
                        (--existing-plans-and-devices) and user group permissions (--user-
                        group-permissions) must be explicitly specified if this option is
                        used.
      --startup-script STARTUP_SCRIPT_PATH
                        The path to the script with startup code. The script is loaded each
                        time the RE Worker environment is opened. Example:
                        '~/startup/scripts/scripts.py'. Paths to the list of existing plans
                        and devices (--existing-plans-and-devices) and user group permissions
                        (--user-group-permissions) must be explicitly specified if this option
                        is used.
      --existing-plans-devices EXISTING_PLANS_AND_DEVICES_PATH
                        Path to file that contains the list of existing plans and devices. The
                        path may be a relative path to the profile collection directory. If
                        the path is directory, then the default file name
                        'existing_plans_and_devices.yaml' is used.
      --user-group-permissions USER_GROUP_PERMISSIONS_PATH
                        Path to file that contains lists of plans and devices available to
                        users. The path may be a relative path to the profile collection
                        directory. If the path is a directory, then the default file name
                        'user_group_permissions.yaml' is used.
      --redis-addr REDIS_ADDR
                        The address of Redis server, e.g. 'localhost', '127.0.0.1',
                        'localhost:6379' (default: localhost).
      --kafka-topic KAFKA_TOPIC
                        The kafka topic to publish to.
      --kafka-server KAFKA_SERVER
                        Bootstrap server to connect (default: 127.0.0.1:9092).
      --zmq-data-proxy-addr ZMQ_DATA_PROXY_ADDR
                        The address of ZMQ proxy used to publish data. If the parameter is
                        specified, RE is subscribed to 'bluesky.callbacks.zmq.Publisher' and
                        documents are published via 0MQ proxy. 0MQ Proxy (see Bluesky 0MQ
                        documentation) should be started before plans are executed. The
                        address should be in the form '127.0.0.1:5567' or 'localhost:5567'.
                        The address is passed to 'bluesky.callbacks.zmq.Publisher'. It is
                        recommended to use Kafka instead of 0MQ proxy in production data
                        acquisition systems and use Kafka instead.
      --keep-re         Keep RE created in profile collection. If the flag is set, RE must be
                        created in the profile collection for the plans to run. RE will also
                        keep all its subscriptions. Also must be subscribed to the Data Broker
                        inside the profile collection, since '--databroker-config' argument is
                        ignored.
      --use-persistent-metadata
                        Use msgpack-based persistent storage for scan metadata. Currently this
                        is the preferred method to keep continuously incremented sequence of
                        Run IDs between restarts of RE.
      --databroker-config DATABROKER_CONFIG
                        Name of the Data Broker configuration file.

    Configure console output:
      The arguments allow to configure printing and publishing of the console output
      generated by RE Manager. The arguments allow to set the address of 0MQ socket
      and enable/disable printing and/or publishing of the console output.

      --zmq-publish-console-addr ZMQ_PUBLISH_CONSOLE_ADDR
                        The address of ZMQ server (stdout and stderr publishing), e.g.
                        'tcp://*:60625' (default: tcp://*:60625).
      --zmq-publish-console {ON,OFF}
                        Enable (ON) or disable (OFF) publishing of console output to 0MQ
                        (default: OFF).
      --console-output {ON,OFF}
                        Enable (ON) or disable (OFF) printing of console output in the Re
                        Manager terminal. (default: ON)

    Logging verbosity settings:
      The default logging settings (loglevel=INFO) provide optimal amount of data to monitor
      the operation of RE Manager. Select '--verbose' option to see detailed data on received and
      sent messages, added and executed plans, etc. Use options '--quiet' and '--silent'
      to see only warnings and error messages or disable logging output.

      --verbose         Set logger level to DEBUG.
      --quiet           Set logger level to WARNING.
      --silent          Disables logging output.

.. _qserver_cli:

qserver
-------

``qserver`` CLI tool allows to communicate with the server by typing commands in command
line. The tool is primarily intended for testing or diagnostics of Queue Server and emergency use
in production. The tool supports most of the Queue Server 0MQ API including submitting plans,
opening and closing of RE Worker environment, starting and stopping the queue, etc.
Refer to ``qserver`` help for the full list of supported commands.

If RE Manager 0MQ address is different from the default, use the optional ``--address``
parameter to pass the address to ``qserver``. If encryption is enabled at RE Manager,
set the environment variable ``QSERVER_ZMQ_PUBLIC_KEY`` to a string representing valid
public address of the 0MQ server. Use :ref:`qserver_zmq_keys_cli` tool to generate a new
public/private key pair or generate public key from known server private key.

`qserver` may used in monitoring mode (``qserver monitor``). In this mode the tool
periodically requests and displays the status of Queue Server.

``qserver -h`` displays help information:

.. code-block::

    $ qserver -h
    usage: qserver [-h] [--address ADDRESS] command [command ...]

    Command-line tool for communicating with RE Monitor.
    bluesky-queueserver version 0.0.3.post60.dev0+g899354f.

    positional arguments:
      command           a sequence of keywords and parameters that define the command

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --address ADDRESS, -a ADDRESS
                        Address of the server, e.g. 'tcp://127.0.0.1:60615' (default:
                        'tcp://localhost:60615').

    If RE Manager is configured to use encrypted ZeroMQ communication channel,
    the encryption must also be enabled before running 'qserver' CLI tool by setting
    the environment variable QSERVER_ZMQ_PUBLIC_KEY to the value of a valid public key
    (z85-encoded 40 character string):

        export QSERVER_ZMQ_PUBLIC_KEY='<public_key>'

    Encryption is disabled by default.

    qserver queue add plan after '<uid>' '<plan-params>'   # Insert the plan after the plan with given UID
    NOTE: Position indices are 0-based. Inserting a plan to position 0 pushes it to the front of the queue.
          Negative position indices are counted from the back of the queue. Request for a plan with index -1
          returns the last plan of the queue. Inserting a plan at position -1 makes it previous to last.

    If called with 'safe off' option, the request will force RE Manager to terminate RE Worker process and
    exit even if a plan is running.

    qserver manager kill test  # Kills RE Manager by stopping asyncio event loop. Used only for testing.

.. _qserver_list_plans_devices_cli:

qserver-list-plans-devices
--------------------------

It is recommended to run ``qserver-list-plans-devices`` each time the startup code is modified,
which and serves two purposes:

- Validation of startup code. If startup code is successfully loaded by ``qserver-list-plans-devices``
  it is very likely that it will be successfully loaded into the RE Worker environment.

- Generation of the list of existing plans and devices (``existing_plans_and_devices.yaml``).

It is **REQUIRED** to run the tool each time new devices or plans are added to the startup code
or signatures of the existing plans are modified (e.g. a parameter is added or removed, type
annotation or text description is changed etc.), since those changes require a new
``existing_plans_and_devices.yaml`` file to be generated.

The default name for the output file is ``existing_plans_and_devices.yaml``. The file is always
saved to the current directory unless a different path is specified using the ``--file-dir``
parameter. If the output file must have name different from the default, the new name
can be specified using the ``--file-name`` parameter.

The tool may load startup code from IPython startup script collection, Python script or Python module.
Use ``--startup-dir``, ``--startup-script`` and ``--startup-module`` parameters to specify
the path to the directory with startup files, the path to a startup script or module name respectively.

``qserver-list-plans-devices -h`` displays help information:

    bluesky-queueserver version 0.0.3.post61.dev0+g45f1afb

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --file-dir FILE_DIR
                        Directory name where the list of plans and devices is saved. By
                        default, the list is saved to the file
                        'existing_plans_and_devices.yaml' in the current directory.
      --file-name FILE_NAME
                        Name of the file where the list of plans and devices is saved. Default
                        file name: 'existing_plans_and_devices.yaml'.
      --startup-dir STARTUP_DIR
                        Path to directory that contains a set of startup files (*.py and
                        *.ipy). All the scripts in the directory will be sorted in
                        alphabetical order of their names and loaded in the Run Engine Worker
                        environment. The set of startup files may be located in any accessible
                        directory. For example, 'qserver-list-plans-devices --startup-dir .'
                        loads startup files from the current directory and saves the lists to
                        the file in current directory.
      --startup-module STARTUP_MODULE_NAME
                        The name of the module that contains the startup code. The module must
                        be installed in the current environment For example, 'qserver-list-
                        plans-devices --startup-module some.startup.module' loads startup code
                        from the module 'some.startup.module' and saves results to the file in
                        the current directory.
      --startup-script STARTUP_SCRIPT_PATH
                        The path to the script with startup code. For example, 'qserver-list-
                        plans-devices --startup-script ~/startup/scripts/script.py' loads
                        startup code from the script and saves the results to the file in the
                        current directory.

.. _qserver_zmq_keys_cli:

qserver-zmq-keys
----------------

Use this tool to generate random public-private key pairs for securing 0MQ control communication
channel used by RE Manager:

- **private key** - set as a value of ``QSERVER_ZMQ_PRIVATE_KEY`` environment variable at
  workstation or server running RE Manager

- **public key** - set as a value of `QSERVER_ZMQ_PUBLIC_KEY`` environment variable at
  the workstation(s) running the client application(s).

If server private key is know, the public key may be generated by passing the private
key to ``qserver-zmq-keys`` using ``--zmq-private_key``.


``qserver-zmq-keys -h`` displays help information:

.. code-block::

    $ qserver-zmq-keys -h
    usage: qserver-zmq-keys [-h] [--zmq-private-key ZMQ_PRIVATE_KEY]

    Bluesky-QServer:
    ZMQ security: Generate public-private key pair for ZeroMQ control communication channel.
    bluesky-queueserver version 0.0.3.post61.dev0+g45f1afb.

    Generate new public-private key pair for secured 0MQ control connection between
    RE Manager and client applications. If private key is passed as ``--zmq-private-key``
    parameter, then the generated key pair is based on the provided private key.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --zmq-private-key ZMQ_PRIVATE_KEY
                        Private key used by RE Manager. If the private key is provided, then
                        the public key is generated based on the private key. This option
                        allows to create (recover) public key based on known private key. The
                        passed value should be 40 character string containing z85 encrypted
                        key.

.. _qserver_console_monitor_cli:

qserver-console-monitor
-----------------------

``qserver-console-monitor`` is a simple application that subscribes to the console output (``stdout`` and
``stderr``) published by RE Manager via 0MQ and prints the received messages to terminal (to ``stdout``).
The console output printed by the monitor is expected to be identical to the output printed in
RE Manager terminal. The monitor may be run on the same workstation as RE Manager or any computer,
which can access the workstation running RE Manager over the network. If the address of
the 0MQ socket is different from default, it can be passed to the monitor application
as a parameter (``--zmq-subscribe-addr``). RE Manager does not publishing the console output
to 0MQ socket by default. Publishing can be enabled by starting RE Manager with the parameter
``--zmq-publish-console``:

.. code-block::

    start-re-manager --zmq-publish-console ON

(see :ref:`start_re_manager_console_output`).

``qserver-console-monitor -h`` displays help information:

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help        show this help message and exit
      --zmq-subscribe-addr ZMQ_SUBSCRIBE_ADDR
                        The address of ZMQ server to subscribe, e.g. 'tcp://127.0.0.1:60625'
                        (default: tcp://localhost:60625).
